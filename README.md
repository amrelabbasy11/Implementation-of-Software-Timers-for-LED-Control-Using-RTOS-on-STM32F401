# Implementation-of-Software-Timers-for-LED-Control-Using-RTOS-on-STM32F401
This project demonstrates the use of software timers in a real-time operating system (RTOS) environment on the STM32F401 microcontroller. Two software timers are implemented using CMSIS V2, while four additional timers are created with FreeRTOS APIs.
